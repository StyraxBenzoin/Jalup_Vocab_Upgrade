**Japanese Level Up Maximum Package Vocabulary Upgrade**
=============================================

### Introduction

This script is to upgrade your Japanese Level Up maximum package to include a vocabulary section on your cards. The upgrade allows you to keep all your learning progress if you have already started. 

To Do: Add example image of card with vocab.

# Prerequisites 

This script is written in Python and therefore must be installed to run. Here is a super short bullet point guide on how to install Python for Linux and Windows:

**Linux:**

(Linux usually has Python preinstalled)

* Open a terminal and run `sudo apt-get update` (for Ubuntu-based systems) or `sudo yum update` (for RPM-based systems)
* Install Python with `sudo apt-get install python3` (for Ubuntu-based systems) or `sudo yum install python3` (for RPM-based systems)
* Verify installation with `python3 --version`

**Windows:**

* Go to the official Python download page and download the latest version of Python for Windows
* Run the installer and follow the prompts to install Python
* Make sure to select the option to add Python to your PATH during installation
* Verify installation by opening a new Command Prompt or PowerShell and typing `python --version`

### There are some important steps that must first be carried out manually. All of these steps are critical. Follow exactly.

### Step 0: Backup

**CREATE A BACKUP**. I will not be held responsible for data loss if mistakes are made during this process. Go to **File** > **Export** > **All Decks** and save the file to a safe location.

### Step 1: Import Jalup Files

New users: Import all the Jalup `.apkg` files into Anki. This will import all the media too. Existing users: Skip this step.

### Step 2: Create Jalup Deck

Create a deck called Jalup with subdecks in ascending order. E.g. 'Jalup::01 Beginner', 'Jalup::02 Intermediate', 'Jalup::03 Intermediate', etc.

### Step 3: Move Cards

Move your cards to their corresponding decks.

### Step 4: Create Jalup Note Type

Make a new note type called 'Jalup' and make the following fields. Order is critical! [Sentence, Explanation, Note, Media, Sentence Reading, Vocabulary]

### Step 5: Change Note Type

Go to each subdeck and select all cards, change note type to the 'Jalup' note we just made. Take care to map the correct fields.

**IMPORTANT**: Take extra care when changing note type of the master deck. Some cards (I believe it's the first 250 cards, stage 1) use a different note type where there is no 'Notes' field like the other cards, so select these separately when changing note type and pay attention to the field mapping.

### Step 7: Edit Card Template

Edit the Front, Back, and CSS Styling of the card. Just overwrite what is there with copy and paste from my templates.

### Step 8: Export Jalup Deck

Export your Jalup Anki deck. Export with options 'Notes in plain text', Include: Select your Jalup parent deck. (Check that subdecks MUST be named sequentially; 01 Beginner, 02 Intermediate, etc.). 
Check 'Include HTML and media references' and 'Include deck name'. Everything else left unchecked.

### Step 9: Sort Exported File

Unfortunately, despite all that work, the exported file is not in deck order (and for some reason nothing I do in pandas will sort it the way we need!). Open the file, select all, copy, paste into Google sheets, highlight column A, sort column A to Z ascending, save/download file as `.tsv` (tab separated values)

### Step 10: Prepare Python Script

Place your sorted and saved `.tsv` file in the same folder as this python script. Open `Jalup_Vocab_Upgrade.py` in a text editor and change the string of `input_file` to match your filename. e.g. `input_file = 'myfile.tsv'`

### Step 11: Install Requirements

**Installing Dependencies with `pip`**
=====================================

### Linux

* Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located
* Run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

### Windows

* Open a command prompt and navigate to the directory where your `requirements.txt` file is located
* Run the following command: `pip install -r requirements.txt`

**Note:** Make sure you have Python and `pip` installed on your system before running this command.

### Step 12: Run Python Script

Run `Jalup_Vocab_Upgrade.py`. After a minute or so, a new file `myfile_Vocab_Upgrade.txt` will be written.

### Running a `.py` file

#### Linux
* `python Jalup_Vocab_Upgrade.py` (from the terminal)
* `./Jalup_Vocab_Upgrade.py` (if the file is executable and in the current directory)

#### Windows
* `Jalup_Vocab_Upgrade.py` (from the command prompt)
* Double-click the `Jalup_Vocab_Upgrade.py` file (if Python is associated with `.py` files)

### Step 13: Import Upgraded File

In Anki, import text file, choose options; Field separator: Tab. Allow HTML in fields. Notetype: Jalup. Existing notes: Update. Match Scope: Notetype and deck. Double check the field mapping is correct.

### Step 14: Congratulations!

Click Import. Congratulations! You should now have a fancy vocab upgrade for your Jalup decks. If anything went wrong, you can restore from backup. You DID backup, right?
